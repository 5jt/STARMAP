STARMAP book
============

This project is to convert to machine-readable form a printed copy of the book <cite>STARMAP</cite> by Paul Berry and John Thorstensen.

The book was published in 1978 as a reprint of an IBM Technical Report from 1973. It describes an exercise in ‘expository programming’: calculating the visible position of moon, planets and bright stars as a function of time and geolocation.

The aim here is to replicate the content in Markdown so that

-   it can be published in HTML
-   used to inform a project to recreate the original software in Dyalog APL

The starting point is a PDF containing scans of the book pages, in STARMAP.pdf.
